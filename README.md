Exploratory Data:

Summer is quickly approaching and outdoor dining might still be something many New Yorkers will like to enjoy. My exploratory data will read as a “blog”, for New Yorkers or visitors to explore the restaurants that are re-opening. The data being used is from the NYC Open Data, which is being collected from restaurants who are filing the application form for authorization to reopen or having outdoor seating.
